# QLFactChecking

This project contains scripts for preparation of Fact Checking in the Qatar Living community forum.

## Setup

Copy the XML file with the annotations for True and False comments in directory *data/input*.
The file name should be input-**set_name**.xml, where **set_name** is the name of the dataset contained in the file.

The set name can be changed in file *RunCV.py -> SET_NAME*.

## Run

The project was built with Python 3.5. You will need Python 3 to run it.

You will need to install the following Python modules: **scikit-learn**, **numpy**.

In order to run the classificaiton, execute the file *RunMultiple.py* in directory *code/classification/answers*.

The results will be saved in directory: *data/results*. The predictions for each examples will be saved in directory *data/predictions*.

## Feature Combinations

To run the features combinations, execute the file **combine_best_feature_groups.py**.

The results are read from file *data/results/results-answers-cross-validation-dev+test.tsv* (this file is also configured in **combine_best_feature_groups.py -> RESULTS_FILE** ) and are written in the same file.

To specify whether the results should be sorted by Accuracy or MAP, change the value of **combine_best_feature_groups.py -> RESULT_SCORE_INDEX**. You can also change the prefix of the runs, to differ them in the results file, in **combine_best_feature_groups.py -> RUN_PREFIX**.


## Features

To add new features:

* Add the feature file in folder **data/features**. To allow unified reading of all feature files, the file name needs to be of the form *PREFIX1-feature_description-PREFIX2*. The prefixes can be changed in file **Features.py**.

The feature files need to contain one line for each answer. The line contains the answer ID followed by the features extracted for this answer, separated with tabs. (*example: Q273_R39_C4	0	0	0	0	114	6	19*)

* In **Features.py** add a new method for reading your file.

* Add your features as a new set or combine it with other features in the file **FeatureSets.py**.

* In file **RunMultiple.py**, add the newly configured set for execution.


## Baselines

Several baselines are being computed when the results file is being created for the first time. If you need a fresh computing of the baselines, you need to remove this file from the **results** directory.

You can exclude execution of the bag-of-words and ngrams baselines by setting the value of *INCLUDE_TEXT_BASELINES* in the file *RunCV.py* to *False*.


## Search Engines

The folder **data/search engine sources** contains files with information related to extracting information from search engines. 

* File **qatar-related-site-credibility.tsv** contains manually annotated list of websites. Possible labels are: reputed-source, forum-type, others. They also contain annotations whether the website is Qatar related.

* File **search-engine-results.zip** is an archive with queries and result snippets from the search engine for each answer.

* File **best-snippets-google-QL.tsv** contains only web data that has the highest similarity to the original QA-pair.

## Evidence for Factuality

The file **data/label explnation/answer-labels-explanation.csv** contains the answer labels and explanation or proof (with an URL) for the chosen label. 
Some answers might lack explanation, these are mostly the cases where the label is obvious. Such labels are "Responder Unsure" and "NonFactual".
