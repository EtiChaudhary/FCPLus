QUESTION: I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.
	 COMMENT : "We came from here from the US and had Hep A; Typhoid; and Tdap (combined Tetanus; Diptheria; Pertussis) on top of the usual program. The Hep A was a two dose one; given six months apart. We went to our local Kelsey-Seybold clinic there and were given an international certificate of vaccination as approved by the World Health Organisation. *********** ""There's this thing called being so open-minded your brains drop out"". - Richard Dawkins"
	 COMMENT : Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.
	 COMMENT : It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.
	 COMMENT : I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)
	 COMMENT : As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?

QUESTION: I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls. Apparently this breed is banned. Would I have trouble importing them? If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.
	 COMMENT : Yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous. Because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait. You can talk to Doha Airport to be sure about that.
	 COMMENT : If they are 'banned'; as you suggest; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar.
	 COMMENT : "they are definitely banned in Qatar... so as LP said; how do you want to import something which is banned? Custom is not going to let them in... frankly speaking; for me it sounds a bit nonsense ""very well behaved people friendly pitbulls"".. as for me; these two don't come together; it's EITHER ""very well behaved people friendly"" or ""pitbulls"".. sorry; eh?... hope your husband won't be able to figure out my real name and address.. :)"

QUESTION: i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?
	 COMMENT : 8-10 degrees i guess?? more than the temp its the wind that makes u go crazy...
	 COMMENT : winter here in Qatar is very nice; sunny in the morning and afternoon; cool at night. some times you feel of cold and you need heater. but in general; it is lovely season. at least you can enjoy walking
	 COMMENT : In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.

QUESTION: While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?
	 COMMENT : there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.
	 COMMENT : yes there is a law; unfortunately; not too much enforcement and some people are too arrogant to follow.. i see lots everyday..

QUESTION: What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.
	 COMMENT : "While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions). We'll have playgroups; Mums Night Out; and Expectant Moms Group; etc. There are no dues or anything like that. . .just fun :o)"

QUESTION: Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks
	 COMMENT : Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The iron contained in hemoglobin is responsible for the red color of blood. You should eat Alot of green vegitables and salads; your HB will come up dont worry...
	 COMMENT : Heamoglobin is a component of the blood. If you are deficient in it; it means that if you have an accident or cut yourself; you will bleed easier and for a longer period of time.
	 COMMENT : Homoglobin is a prejudice against globin....... Its actually haemoglobin; a deficiency can be due to many factors.....if you are deficient you are known as being anaemic...google it for more details....
	 COMMENT : Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .
	 COMMENT : Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....
	 COMMENT : "Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."
	 COMMENT : "Hemoglabin is one of spideman's enemy.. oh i think that's greengoblin. just kidding; Definition of Hemoglabin Hem""o*glo""bin (?); n. [Hemo- + globe.] (Physiol.) The normal coloring matter of the red blood corpuscles of vertebrate animals. It is composed of hematin and globulin; and is also called hæmatoglobulin. In arterial blood; it is always combined with oxygen; and is then called oxyhemoglobin. It crystallizes under different forms from different animals; and when crystallized; is called hæmatocrystallin."
