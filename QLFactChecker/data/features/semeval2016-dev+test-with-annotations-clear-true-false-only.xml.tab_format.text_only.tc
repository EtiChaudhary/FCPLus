vaccinations needed before I come to Doha ? I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha . I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over . I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the us . any insight would be much appreciated . 
yes there are ; though it varies depending on which country you come from . in the UK ; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each . I'll imagine they have the same in the us . 
I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar . they should have in their system what shots you need before coming over . it is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid I think ( please excuse the spelling ) 
it depends what you have had already . you don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK ( not sure about us ) but you can have rabies as optional if you want . although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here ; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid ; yellow fever ; etc . children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school . in the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come . 
as I said ; the official advice is that you don't have to ; however ; they may offer you rabies ; typhoid and Hep B as an option . as they no longer boost Tetanus as routine ; you would have to have a booster before coming . that said ; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity ( where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent ) and cases are low . personally as long as there is a low risk ; I would have all the vaccinations I could ; why not ? 
we came from here from the us and had Hep a ; typhoid ; and Tdap ( combined Tetanus ; Diptheria ; Pertussis ) on top of the usual program . the Hep a was a two dose one ; given six months apart . we went to our local Kelsey-Seybold clinic there and were given an international certificate of vaccination as approved by the world health organisation .

can I bring my pitbulls to Qatar ? I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls . apparently this breed is banned . would I have trouble importing them ? if anything happened to the dogs ; my husband would die ; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away . so I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job . 
if they are ' banned ' ; as you suggest ; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar . 
they are definitely banned in Qatar ... so as LP said ; how do you want to import something which is banned ? custom is not going to let them in ... frankly speaking ; for me it sounds a bit nonsense " very well behaved people friendly pitbulls " .. as for me ; these two don't come together ; it's either " very well behaved people friendly " or " pitbulls " .. sorry ; eh ?... hope your husband won't be able to figure out my real name and address .. :) 
yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous . because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait . you can talk to Doha airport to be sure about that . 
how cold is Doha during winter ? I am just curious how cold is Doha during winter ? 
8-10 degrees I guess ? more than the temp its the wind that makes u go crazy ... 
in 2006 it was a lovely winter . it was dark ; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December . we got trapped in Doha on new years Eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain . it rained on and off until April and then warmed up . the coldest night was 5C but generally 7C . I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007 . this last winter wasn't very cold at all ; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night . I love winters here ; they are so cosy . on the down side ; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere . the roads don't drain very well so very wet . 
winter here in Qatar is very nice ; sunny in the morning and afternoon ; cool at night . some times you feel of cold and you need heater . but in general ; it is lovely season . at least you can enjoy walking 
child seat belts . while driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident . a man was driving with his child on his lap . he had to make an emergency stop and his Childs head impacted the steering wheel . the poor child was bleeding and crying . many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles . is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar ? 
there is a law . no children under 10 in the front seats . unfortunately this law is not enforced . did you take the guys license plate # and report him ? maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child . poor child has an idiot for a parent . 
yes there is a law ; unfortunately ; not too much enforcement and some people are too arrogant to follow .. I see lots everyday .. 
car seats . what carseat brands are available in Qatar ? I& #180 ; m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway ; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats ; and are a bit worried that they will break them . 
while car seats are available in Qatar ; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already ; and the selection will not exactly " wow " you . unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention . I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine . I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape . if you can't find them ; though ; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag . hope that helps ; expat Sue& #241 ;o P.S. I am starting a mums and kids group here in Doha for expats . be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive ( or before if you have any questions ) . we'll have playgroups ; mums night out ; and Expectant moms group ; etc . there are no dues or anything like that . . . just fun :o ) 
we brought ours from the UK .. we just bubble wrapped it and checked it in with the rest of the lugguage simple as that . he who DARES WINS 
kid with Guardian . any one knows ; is it allowed to keep one year old kid in the lap of her mom in the front seat ( not in the driving seat ; of course) ? 
no anyone under 10 is not alowed to sit infront . 
no it is against the new driving laws thank God " I fight with love and I laugh with rage ; you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change . " Ani Difranco 
I guess the first question would be-why would you ? but ; you cannot have your children in the front seat with you . 
any private beaches in Qatar ? any private beaches in Qatar ? let me know if I can take my booze for beach party 
while going to Shammal after 40 km from Doha you will find Al Gawariya resort ; beautiful on sea side and open beach to play around ; you will love to go again and again ; have fun . 
there is a private beach on North ( Shamal ) road at 83 exit . the place name is ghaariya . you have to take right at this exit and go further 1 km till you reach an intersection . in this intersection again take right and go further until first left comes . on first left you r gonna see a big radar anteena . the private beach is just beside this big anteena . note : this beach is either for couples or families . 
where can I get to buy a goldfish here ? I tried getting contact numbers of a couple of places ; but they wouldnt answer the phone ! 
you may find different types of fish and gold fish in Aqua art shop along Salwa road just opposite of hardees . 
the shop name is Goldenfish leading to MANSOORA from Najma area . the Tel no . @TEL ask for Aseela . I myself bought from them very good and very resonable price . they have acqatic plants too . 
also try souq Waqif .. 
you can go to Al Nasser area beside family food center you can find different kind of fish ... anyway if you cannot find there just go to fish market ... joke dude ... 
what is Homoglobin ? please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz doctor told me your homoglobin is low ! thanks 
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs . the iron contained in hemoglobin is responsible for the red color of blood . you should eat alot of green vegitables and salads ; your hb will come up dont worry ... 
Heamoglobin is a component of the blood . if you are deficient in it ; it means that if you have an accident or cut yourself ; you will bleed easier and for a longer period of time . 
Homoglobin is a prejudice against globin ... its actually haemoglobin ; a Deficiency can be due to many factors ... if you are deficient you are known as being anaemic ... Google it for more details ... 
hi ; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query ; if you need more details ; read the follwoing : the role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body . the red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin ; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow . each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme . each heme molecule has one Atom of iron ; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin ; hence ; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron . this structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin . this reaction is reversible ; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues . in general ; the blood of men usually has a greater concent 
Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells . it picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the Viability of cells . Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that " stick together " . both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally . one of the component proteins is called alpha ; the other is beta . before birth ; the beta protein is not expressed . a hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development ; called gamma ; substitutes up until birth . 
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess . they are responsible of healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks . if you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . there body needs Oxygen but the hemo . aint functioning in the way they have to . 
Hemoglabin is one of spideman's enemy .. oh I think that's greengoblin . just kidding ; definition of Hemoglabin Hem " o*glo " Bin (?); n . [ Hemo- + globe . ] ( Physiol . ) the normal coloring matter of the red blood corpuscles of vertebrate animals . it is composed of hematin and globulin ; and is also called h& #230 ; matoglobulin . in arterial blood ; it is always combined with oxygen ; and is then called oxyhemoglobin . it crystallizes under different forms from different animals ; and when crystallized ; is called h& #230 ; matocrystallin . 
recycling places in Doha . hello to all ! to get rid of my collected old bottles ; paper ; glasses and so on I ask you - where can I find some recycling places in Doha ?

thats right + we also have got recycle thing is Dahal Al Hamam park wch is close to Landmark mall X 
there are recycling bins for plastic and paper in education City too . but park is better idea as there are bins for aluminium and glass as well . I think there should be a recycling awareness campaign on QL .

yes you can kapila . easy to do - you just need to give the new sponsor ( when she finds a job ) a n o-o bjection letter which states that you allow her to take up employment .

I have visiting visa for work ; so can I drive ; I have Egyptian license ? I have visiting visa for work ; so can I drive ; I have Egyptian license ? 
no you cannot .. if you have international driving license you can ... anyway I don't know exactly just check with rent a car shop near by your area .. 
no you cannot .. if you have international driving license you can ... anyway I don't know exactly just check with rent a car shop near by your area .. 
no . you cant drive with other then GCC license . I also think that I can but law is clear . you need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license . be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong . if you make any accident then you will see the problems . best wishes . P.S. if you go to make driving license and you fall ... make like I was ... give to sudani man big boss there some money and this is it . I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence . this is not secret just life in Doha . CORRUPTION every where . can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive ... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff . nice good cars ... and I have more then 26 years driver lic . and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries ... not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha . every day I see 5-6 accident . driver ? so sorry just true-Indian . good luck in driving with proper documents . penalty is tooooo 
if you are on a visiting visa and and you have an international driver license you can use it for 6 month I guess . if you get the permanent residence you can not use the int driver license anymore . 
Mr. Calculator consumes major space for the same answer which is not helping the person with right answer ?! ; you can not drive a car with Egypitian licence here ; as a visitor first 10 days you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 months . you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye-test for this licence . 
no ; you cannot drive ; you should have a GCC license not Egyptian . 
driving with USA license . I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car . is it legal to drive using USA driver license or do I need and international one ? 
the rental companies ask for an international license . 
get international driver license . 
even if you have a international license ; you need to get a temporary license from traffic department . when you are in Doha ; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa traffic department along with copy of your us license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page you might need to get an NOC from the sponsor ( typed in Arabic ) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor . best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it . 
if you in VIST visa you can drive ; but if you want to cavnt to Qatari ; so you can apply easly just VIST to traffic dept and ask for new one . 
supposedly the us license is good for ( 7 ) days . an international license is good for ( 6 ) months . they are easily obtained from AAA for about $15 . after ( 6 ) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license . 
I recommend that you go to a AAA agency and get an international license . driving here in Doha is pretty dangerous- so I recommend you take every measure to protect yourself . it is pretty easy and not costly . see you when you get here ! 
where does your dog stay in Qatar when you& #8217 ; re away ? hello Qatarliving ! my family and I will be away for vacation . please tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you& #8217 ; re out of town ! I don& #8217 ; t know where to take him and I don& #8217 ; t trust anyone to do that for me :-( 
call paul Hensen . his number 487 7144 and mobile 667 5235 . you can say Sam's Mum recommended him ( his daughter and my son in the same class at school ) . 
ok ; I have a cat . but we take him to pampered pets whenever we travel . they also board dogs ... the do a great job ; and I know lots of people who take their animals there . if your dog is social ; he can play with the other dogs each day . if not ; he can stay by himself . they cater to each individual animal and know them by name . ( I'm " Rackety's owner " -- they know him ; not me ! ) the only catch is that they book up really far in advance . call as far in advance as you can to book your space . website : @URL you can see photos of the place and get all the details there . they are way out of town ; but will pick up your dog if you can't make it out there . 
Calle Poppy - Janet from Paws and claws . her number is 528 6335 . she might still have place . when you go away you should idealy book your dogs in early in the year ; because at this time the places are almost fully booked up . X 
I want to adopt a dog ... I want someone to share my life with ... but I want Labrador Retriever .. is there any chance I can find here in Qatar ?

experience necessary for NHA license ? hello guy . want to take NHA licensure(Nurse ) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippine . ' m currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1y . ill NHA allowed me to take Licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required ? help pleas . Hanks a lot and godbless .. 
you must have two years of work experience to apply for the license . you can work for another year and carry on with it . since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply . hope this helps 
you might have a problem getting an NHA license because of lack of experience . your employer might even be in trouble for employing you even though you don't have a license to work as nurse here in Qatar . 
you shouldn't be working anywhere in Qatar without an NHA license ; so continuing in your current job for another year & then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working illegally !... you need to have minimum 2 years work experience outside Qatar before coming here ; if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam ?... so if you want to legally work in Qatar ; go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work legally . ) ; get two years legal work experience then come back here ; get your degree ; certificates & work experience reviewed by dataflow ; then apply to take the Licensure exam ... 
I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by prometric . you can try to schedule the exam online . however ; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license . Moreover ; if you pass the exam ; the validity is only for 2 years ; otherwise you have to take it again . 
Indian wedding outfit ( Lehnga) ? hi ; I am gonna get married soon so I was wondering if anyone knew where I am able to get a wedding lehnga made or brought thanks 
I dont think you get good ones in Doha . are you looking for white ? mostly wedding dresses in India comes in bright colors mostly in red . you can do a Google search there are some Indian designers who take online orders . try Dana centre in souq they have some heavy Lacha/Lehnga material ... not sure if someone here can stich it properly . 
can a wife sponsor his husband here ? hi ! just want to know if a wife can sponsor his husband here ? my friend is asking . all I know is that a husband as well as a father can . but I'm not sure whether a wife can . thanks

that is not a problem ; I got several friends that are sponsored by their wife's . 
n . think not possible ... but u just try ... may B it can ... 
it certainly is possible ... I sponsor my husband ... 
if the wife is working ... yes she can sponsor her husband here like what my officemate did last year .. she sponsored her husband and now the husband is also working here and after nine months they were able to get their daughter ... so now they are one happy family here in Doha :-) 
sponsorship does not matter about gender ; it depends on salary ; educational qualification and RP of sponsorer . ok .

3rd cousin relationship ; possible ? is 3rd cousin relationship already accepted in church or in society ? I mean like " lovers " ... 
even the thought of it is a sin ... yaiiiks ! 
I think in the UK it's legal for cousins to be " lovers " . but any closer relation than that is illegal . here I believe it's more common . 
looking at this diagram I'd say 3rd cousins are so far apart there's no problem . and as I said ; I think the UK even allows 1st cousin relationships .

what is the monthly salary ? what is the monthly salary paid by oil companies such as Qatar Petroleum ; Qatar gas ; shell ; Dolphin energy ; etc for an expatriate Mechanical engineer with 28 years of working experience in the oil & gas industry ? 
well I can answer u tha . was working with one recruitment company where v used to employ people from all parts of the world for oil & gas SECTO . had witnessed some people of ur calibure demanding upto 40000 + car + housing allowance + other benefits ... if u r a Westerner then u have a upper han . can demand more and can negotiate furthe . nd sorry I cant tell u the name of the company where v placed our candidates . but v worked for almost all major comapnies of here . o good luck ! 
hi there .. with 28 years experience on these companies more than 25000Qatari riyals excluding accommodation and car ... good luck ! 
28years of working experience will surely lead u to some senior or supervisor post ... & Moreover a manager to . as I have been working with oil & gas company prior to my present employment ; I guess ; you will be offered atleast QAR 32 ; 000 ( basic ) & will have a very high accomodation allowance from which you will be able to save really goo .! 
28 yrs of experience sure will land you with a min salary of 30K plus all the allowances ~ probably more good luck ~ 
hey Djmix ; well I know you're right saying that it is Confidential ; but we are trying to help qatarprospect . anyway ; I also work in an oil & gas company as a maintenance planner ; and am paid well . I would recommend you to join RasGas ; where you get a annual ticket fares ( whether you go or not ; you actually get around 4 ; 000 more ); get a paid annual vacation ( recieve your salary even when you are on holidays for those expenses ); accomodation provided with free electricity and local phone call bills ; and too much more benefits . for a Mechanical engineer will be around QAR 26 ; 000 . and you also get to live in a world-class peaceful community ; also known as the Al Khor community ; with families of QatarGas ' and RasGas ' employees . all the benefits in RasGas are also provided in QatarGas ; but RasGas has a bit more higher salary and you get monthly trips to sealine beach resort for Quad-biking and jet skiing ; and also get PSP's; expensive mobile phones etc . hope you get a good job and hope I

flight benefits for Qatar Airways employees . I am seriously considering working for Qatar Airways but don't seem to be able to find out what kind of flight benefits they offer for their employees and family . anyone who know more about this or if they even offer flight benefits ? I know it is not the most important part of the contract but all other airlines offer it ! thanks .. 
yeah ; you get free flights but you have to give out a few drinks/food and clear away a bag of vomit to get the free flights ; and the destination probably isn't where you would choose but hey its a flight ... mmmmm free flight to Thiruvananthapuram ... nice .. 
u will get free flights but they will charge you some percentage ( within 6 months- 1 time ) I heard like that . 
huh ? FOC ticket once a yr and the rest will be rebated travel on subload basis ... Life's too short so make the most of it ; you only live but once ... 
each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself ; and her/his family ( depending on one's grade ) . which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade . they are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets ; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full . it's an industry practice .

where to buy Sarees in Doha . hello everybody ; I was wondering where can I buy sarees ( spelling ? ) in Doha ( the traditionnal Indian ones ; 100% silk with hand made embrodery : e.g. the one used for weeding ) I did a search on Google but couldn't find anything ! I really appreciate your help thanks DHW 
there are a lot of shops in national area ; near Q-tel signal . Bombay Silks is one such shop where you ll get all kind of sarees ... 
try Bombay silk and other shops in that area .. 
hey man ; you asked she answered ; now the best or not the best well ... tough question ... just kidding ... anyways ; PARTHAS ; Bombay silk ;s Dulhan ; are all good places to buy Sarees ... or you could do the Lulu Hypermarket instead where they have a saree station ... lol cheers ... 
you don& #8217 ; t get the original hand embroidery sarees here . you cant get 1005 silk sarees in Bombay Silks ; & #160 ;D ulhan& #160 ; or the saree shop in Lulu centre . & #160 ; & #160 ; are you going to ware it as saree or to stitch some dress with that saree ( many Arab woman do that ) you get good quality embroidered silk clothes in Al Dana centre in the souq 
u can get them at Bombay silk center and they even have them at Lulu . no human can stop racism . 
& #160 ; all the 3 places PARTHAS ; bonbay Silks ; & dhulan have a good choise the ones at Lulu r ok the material was not too good

wife residency visa . hi ; my wife was on a visit visa ; today ; her residency visa was issued ; so I went to immigration and paid 500 so there is no need to leave the country and enter again on the residency visa . she has done her medical before for the visit visa extension ; do we need to do the medical again for the residency visa ? thanks 
yes . you need to go again to the medical commission for the medical . but this time no more x-ray . after the result came out . go to the CID for the finger Printing . after the result ; you can go to immigration(gate 2 ) for the visa stamping and ID . 
yes ; you have to do both x-ray and blood test . please also go to clinic or whatever to get your blood group . I just finished all process and got 3 years visa . good luck for you and your wife .

ya why not bring some coconuts with you too no problem habibi 
ok as long as it stays in place during a sand storm ; and he does not lift it to cover his face instead . 
friend no need to check anybody ; I brought my father many times here ; he is only wearing dhothi ; friends ; each country have their own culture and traditional wears ; please respect ; it is better than some shots which some body wearing in public ; 
H . don't think there's any issu . ou don't need to check anywher . see travellers dressed in dhotis all the tim . ust get your dad here and have a great time togethe . ts my dream too to bring my parents back to Qatar to stay with me inshalla . nd ignore all the silly post . hey were made by silly people :-) 
he can wear what he likes . hope he has a safe journey and enjoys his stay .. 
respect countries culture ; do not wear things which cause other peoples inconvenient like lungi ; dhoti ; cheddi bla bla . wearing pant or jeans is not difficult task . 
toys for adults ? before anyone comments - I know this is a Muslim country and certain things are forbidden here . but one of our friends is getting married and we want to play some pranks on him n her . so does anyone know if there is any shop in Doha that sells toys for adults or sex toys ? just lemme know . thnx 
I think it is difficult to get them here in Doha . 
not possible 
err ; I don't think you'll find it here ... 
impossible ... 
as you've said this is a Muslim country ; no chance for such things like tha . ARAMMMMMMMMMM ! 
lego blocks . where can I find/buy lego blocks here in Qatar ? tried toys r us ; Villagio ; City center and Landmark but to no avail . 
my brother has a collection of original lego blocks and we buy it from Carrefour ; although lately we haven't seen any lego products from the malls here in Doha ; we even tried toys r us but to no avail . 
duty free . ok ; I know that you can't bring booze into the country . & #194 ; & #160 ; is there anything that should be brought in through duty free ? 
porn and pork . that is 3 of my favourite things banned . 
the 2 P's pretty much sum it up and obviously no sex toys ( unless you're married apparently ); weapons ; or drugs 
big problem . hi ; I have a problem . months ago I went out of Dubai because I had a problem with my employer ; and also because a friend of mine hi died in Dubai . now when I go out of there I had a loan and 2 credit cards ; but I don't pay them because I had no money . now I received a job in Doha Qatar .. is possible for me to go in Qatar and to pay my loan and credit cards from Dubai ? 
yes you can ... good luck 
is there a problem for me ? is there a problem for me here in Qatar having positive for aids ? 
if the authorities are aware you will either not be allowed into Qatar or you will be deported from Qatar asap 
hugging a female friend . hi friends ; I am meeting my childhood female friend after many years in Qatar . she is also an expat like me . will I be arrested or land in trouble if I greet her with a hug ? 
I prefer to avoid in other public settings ; you can never be sure of these things . 
yes better to avoid hugging in public ... even holding hands ... 
physical show of love/affection towards each other by adult opposite sexes in public is something that should to be avoided in Qatar for obvious reasons . if the reason was not obvious ; you wouldn't have asked this question . 
I think in the airport it's ok .. 
where can I go running ; other than the cornich ? 
Aspire Academy . 
you can go to Aspire too .. 
Aspire has a nice lake to jog around . 
other than Corniesh ; mmmm try Al-Corniesh 
you can go to Dahel Alhamaam park ; it's nice and quiet place . 
join the hash house Harriers ! PM me for details ; or find us in Marhaba book 
streets of Doha !

moving to Qatar from the UK . hey there ; I'll be heading out to Qatar later this year . does anyone know if my UK TV set will work in Qatar ? not sure whether to ship or sell ... thanks ; c 
its better to buy a new one ... 
if your TV runs on 240 Volts and is PAL it will work in Qatar . the whole f**king electricity system here is British . 
cs2009 ; yes your TV will work here ; its a 220/240v 50Hz supply out here so all of your electrodomestics will be ok ; however if you've got to pay the shipping yourself I would think twice because there are some great bargains to be had on LCD\plasma sets at the moment . 
IKEA . hi all ; is there any IKEA showroom in and around Doha ? kindly reply thank you 
in Doha no .. in Kuwait yes .. in Dubai yes .. 
not right now but it's coming very soon ! 
there are no IKEA outlets in Doha at present . 
sorry to say no ; as for your transporting furniture here ; that depends on what type of resedence you will get over here ? as normly you will be given a furnished flat/villa 
Doha aquarium . I know I just asked a similar question but is the aquarium in Doha open ? thanks :)

Tipping ? do you do it ; and how much do you leave if you do ? back home we leave 15 -20 percent . 
2 QAR at fuel and 5 to 10 at dinner depending on service . 
5 -10 riyals tops regardless of my bill ! lesser the luxury more the tips ! ( I menat the hotel and not the service ! ) I have to make a big conversation similar to the one in " Reservoir dogs " before I actually end up tipping ! lols 
business meeting ? guys ; I'm just enquiring about what one should wear to business meetings in Doha ? are there certain things a man should or shouldn't wear ( serious replys only - not like a man shouldn't wear a dress) ! thanks - Gino 
Qatari uniform

a formal suit with tie is the best for a business meeting even in this 48 degree temp people ware suit in this country ... dont ware jeans/casuals 
depends on whom u gonna meet .. if its a normal person u can go in formals .. but he is in an important post .. suit is always a gud option .. 
suit + tie even 45 degree temp . 
GCC ban . if a person leaving Qatar for vacation doesnt return back from his country ; are there possibilities for GCC ban apart from the 2 year ban to Qatar ? 
we covered this already ! but dont take my word for it as always ; being as I get my information from someone who gave you the facts from his daily job as a HR exec . you will be banned 2 years ... and considered someone who abandoned his job ... Salam 
no GCC ban ... 
then no ... unless you had a security deportation from Qatar a crime you committed ; you would also be blocked from GCC ... why not just work outside GCC ... ? 
just what to ask if it is possible to work in Qatar if you we're banned in Dubai ? tnx ! 
I believe you can work in Qatar after a 6 month period as opposed to the 2 year period you need to wait in the UAE . 
unless banned B cos of criminal activity ; bank fraud 
I need help from whoever has an iphone ... well ; I have an iphone that is cracked and works fine with everything except for the internet ... can somebody please provide me with the settings for the mobile internet or the edge settings ? thank you .

can an American woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa ? hi ; I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle East bu ... can an American woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa ? 
yes 
you absolutely free .. welcome to Qatar any time and feel free 
yes you can ! " do what you like ! like what you do " that's what I'm saying ... go ahead ur an American . 
without a man you can travel anywhere inside Doha . yes ! it is not like America ; very safe country . nobody steal from you anything ; it's 100% guarantee . also ; out of Qatar you can travel . but ; you need exit permit . yes ; even a man from mass need exit permit once need to go out of Qatar . you are just an Amarican lady only . 
if you stay less than month no need to have exit latter . only you need latter if u stay more than a month .. welecome and good day 
lady's are free to exit Qatar any time no need for any kinds of permanent 
it depends on your visa . if you entered Qatar with the Vsit visa ; ou don't need an exit permit . if you came on business visa and stay less than 1 month ; you still do not need a visa . if you came on business visa and stay more than 1 month ; you will need an exit permit . and if you have an RP here ; you will definitely need an exit permit from your sponsor ; unless you are under your husband's sponsorship . whoever say " lady's do not need an exit permit " ; have no clue what they are saying ... again ; all depends on your status here 
you don't need an exit permit I'm an American woman and I have traveled many times without my husband . no problem . other nationalities ; unfortunately ; are not so lucky . 
where can I buy workout/bodybuilding supplements besides the GNC shops ? can anyone help ? GNC has a small selection and is very expensive . thanks ! 
Al Mana Go-sport at Villagio used to have a decent selection ; though they were out of stock the last time I went there which was a few months back ... 
just to let people know . I went to al-Merqab street today and the sport supplement shop there is closed . so I guess the only alternative left is GNC and perhaps Al Mana Go-sport at Villagio . 
yeah ; it's closed permanently . apparently there is also there is another shop called York sport Nutrition . they have two branches : York sports Nutrition ( shop 1 ) : Tel : @TEL 23 Al & #8211 ; Jazeera st. & #8211 ; Fariq Bin Mahmoud York sports Nutrition ( shop 2 ) : Tel : @TEL Bin Omran main road their webpage is @URL I haven't been there myself but I'll try to go tomorrow .

why its very hard for Pakistani to get RP ? why its very hard like impossible for Pakistani to get RP now adays ?

more salary paying Gulf country ? in my view Qatar pay more salary for workers in Gulf region . my friend argu Kuwait . which country paying more salary for workers ? 
United Arab Emirate . 
Qatar is paying more salary 
I think it is Qatar but I think bcos it is also the most costly place in Gulf . 
I would say Qatar is paying more salary as compare to other Gulf countries . 
I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque . the UAE pays ok and Abu Dhabi is a cheaper and more interesting place to live than Qatar . 
yeah ; may be Qatar . simply because of the cost of living compared to other GCC countries much higher here . Saudi is not paying good salary for the workers . but the workers can enjoy free food and accommodation there with majority of employers . 
Gulf business Magazine ( circa Jan 27 - Feb 8 edition ) featured Gulf salary survey 2009 . according to the survey ; Qatar is generaly paying more than other countries in GCC ; with Kuwait is among the worst . in the other hand ; for similar position ; Arab nationals is paid highest ; followed by western expatriate ; Arab expatriate then Asian expatriate . 
work permit . how many days does it take to finish the processing of a work permit ? 
just today I went for the workpermit medical . I think the process works as follows : 1 . your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued . - max 1 week . 2 . they get a medical date - another week max . 3 . finger Printing - another 3-4 days . 4 . WP card - another 2-3 days . above days are just from my personal experience and may vary . 
these are two different things .. Tepgam67 is asking about work permit while being on family visa . shapil is talking about residence permit . that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice . Tepgam67 ; if you have an RP here ; to obtain a work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL . how long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors . ometimes it takes 3-4 days ; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more . if you don't have an RP here ( i.e. you are on 6 months family visa ); you cannot work ; and therefore you cannot obtain a work permit . 
where is Delhi sweets . when musheirib(National Area)existed ; there was one small sweet shop called Delhi sweets ; where we used to get good laddoos ; samosas and jalebis . but since that area got demolished ; more than a year back .

babysitting in Doha . hi all .. we have a young baby [ 2 months old ] . my wife has to resume work by the middle of September . we are looking for babycare options here . is there any babysitting facility available in Doha ? 
there is a regulated nursery service in Doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place ; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places . but with careful search you should be able to find a nursery place . do ask to see their Ministry registration . outside of this there is the home provision by employing a nanny ; which is a costly activity initially . there is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated . its your choice who you trust this small child with . child care should be planned proir to the babys birth . we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha mums website . good luck . 
we accept baby sistting service link : @URL
