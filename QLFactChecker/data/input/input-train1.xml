			<RelCText>Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken; you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more; then after that; you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days; then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly; apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice; finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only; not extendable so they have to go out the country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>treatment is free;you pay for a health card;nominal pharmacy charges &amp; in case of major surgery;a nominal cost for prosthesis;heart valves;etc...the quality of the treatment however is a whole different issue...as a medically qualified person;my only advice to you would be;if you're going in for major surgery in a public health facility in this country;make sure you've made out your will &amp; settled all your affairs;the chances of you ending up in the mortuary or like a vegetable are fairly high;unless you get to pick the doctor conducting the surgery;which if you don't have the strings to pull high up;you won't get;so bottom line;free/very cheap BUT no guarantees...you have life insurance?! *wink*!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you are under visit visa sponsored by a resident you can. Your sponsor go to immigration and request a single jorney re-entry permit (25Qr I think). You go to Dubai and then back. Just return before your visit visa expires.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>shouldnt be a problem. all the hindus here have photos and the idols as well. the photos and idols arent available here so they got to get it from their home country. there is also a new temple built someplace near the indian embassy where they have regular pujas; esp during the festivals. all is fine alhamdullilah. people are tolerant here. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home</RelCText>
