			<RelQSubject>Vaccinations needed before i come to Doha?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sue&#241;o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions).

			<RelCText>Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells.

Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name.

			<RelCText>You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year &amp; then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates &amp; work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I dont think you get good ones in Doha. Are you looking for white? mostly wedding dresses in India comes in bright colors mostly in red. You can do a Google search there are some Indian designers who take online orders. Try Dana Centre in Souq they have some heavy Lacha/Lehnga material... not sure if someone here can stich it properly.</RelCText>
